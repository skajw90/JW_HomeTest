I have created web page using webAPI and AngularJS,
and used database with Entity Framework.
Use generate button to generate 31 clients 
it has text file that has last name, first name, age, interests, and picture example

I created clear and generate button at the bottom of web page
so that you can create and clear repeatly.

Since my final exam finishd 5/2/2018 at 5 pm, 
it was hard to finish this test with good quality.

I was making add client function for web page, but
I don't have enough time to do, so I decide to delete them.
So I finished basic object with my sample seed data.

Thank you for your consideration.
