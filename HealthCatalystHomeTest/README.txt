I have created web page using webAPI and AngularJS,
and used database with Entity Framework.
Use generate button to generate 31 clients 
it has text file that has last name, first name, age, interests, and picture example

I created add, clear and generate button at the bottom of web page
so that you can create and clear repeatly.

You can use Add Client button to create customized client data. Also you can click the search list to see detail.

Thank you for your consideration.
